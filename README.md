4. Artist Performance & Streaming Distribution

Chris Molitor and Gayle lead in the number of streams, outperforming more globally recognized artists.

The Bar chart shows that while The Weeknd, Ed Sheeran, and Taylor Swift dominate.

Some artists have high popularity scores but relatively lower streaming numbers, meaning their reach extends beyond streaming services (e.g., social media, radio).


Recommendations:



1.Optimize Playlists & Recommendations:

Given the 66-80% danceability range is most popular, curating playlists that fit this criterion will increase engagement.

High-energy songs with major keys should be promoted in workout and party playlists.


2.Focus on Emerging Artists:

Chris Molitor & Gayle have high stream counts, which means they have an engaged audience despite lower total popularity scores.

Promoting less mainstream but high-streaming artists can help target new audiences.


3.Cross-Platform Promotion:

Some artists perform better in popularity scores vs. streams. They can leverage social media, YouTube, and short-form content (Instagram Reels, TikTok).

Collaborations between top-streamed and popular artists can drive mutual growth.


4.Genre-Based Marketing:

Since major key songs dominate, focus marketing strategies on genres that utilize major keys (pop, EDM, upbeat indie).

Use mood-based categorization (happy, workout, relaxing playlists) to target different listener preferences.
